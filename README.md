# Instructions

Pre-requisites:

1. Open using VS Code the root directory
2. From VS Code terminal: "npm install"
3. Open another instance of terminal. Then enter: "mongod" to start the mongodb local database
3. Then head back to the previous terminal then enter "npm run dev"

Wait for the servers to startup. 
The browser will open up automatically.


This is still in development.
I got stucked with the CORS error. When my frontend is trying to request for authorization to the server through google login.

I skipped it for now and use the local login method.

I will rest for a bit the continue later...
